Introduction to Blockchain with Python and Flask API

Blockchain technology has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential to revolutionize various industries, including finance, supply chain, healthcare, and more. It is a decentralized and immutable digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers or nodes in a network. Each transaction is securely linked to the previous one, forming a chain of blocks, hence the name "blockchain."
Python, with its simplicity and versatility, has become a popular programming language for blockchain development. In combination with Flask, a lightweight web framework, you can create powerful blockchain applications with ease.
Using Python, you can implement the core components of a blockchain, such as blocks, transactions, and cryptographic algorithms. You can define a block structure that includes data, a timestamp, and a hash value. The hash value is generated by applying cryptographic hash functions, such as SHA-256, to the block's data and previous block's hash. This ensures the integrity and immutability of the blockchain.
To build a blockchain API with Flask, you can expose endpoints that allow users to interact with the blockchain. For example, you can provide endpoints to retrieve the entire blockchain, add new transactions, and mine new blocks. Flask's simplicity and flexibility make it ideal for handling HTTP requests and responses, enabling seamless integration with the blockchain logic.
